# 🧠 ChurnFlow – Customer Churn Prediction & Explainability

## 🚀 Project Summary

ChurnFlow is a full-featured machine learning project that predicts customer churn using real-world business data. Designed to simulate the kind of churn modeling done by telecom, SaaS, and subscription-based companies, this project emphasizes not only prediction performance but also **model transparency**, **business insight**, and **end-user usability**.

This repository showcases my ability to:
- Think like a business analyst
- Build clean, modular, production-ready ML pipelines
- Communicate insights with visualizations and model explainability

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Predict whether a customer will churn using historical account and service data
- Identify key drivers of churn (e.g., contract type, tenure, monthly charges)
- Clean and preprocess structured data for modeling
- Evaluate and explain predictions using SHAP
- Build a simple dashboard for user interaction (Streamlit – coming in later phase)

## 💼 Business Use Case

Customer churn significantly impacts profitability. Proactively identifying customers at risk allows businesses to intervene with retention strategies such as personalized offers or contract incentives. This model enables those actions through:

- Accurate churn prediction
- Explainable decision support
- Actionable segmentation (e.g., short-tenure, high-charge customers)
